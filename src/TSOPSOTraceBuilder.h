/*  === Thread Identification ===
 *
 * Throughout this class, we will use the following convention for
 * identifying threads:
 *
 * A thread is identified by a pair (proc,aux). For real threads, aux
 * == -1. For auxiliary threads, 0 <= aux. The thread (0,-1) is the
 * single original thread in each execution. The thread (proc,-1) is
 * the proc:th thread that was created during the execution. The
 * thread (proc,aux) for 0 <= aux is an auxiliary thread of
 * (proc,-1). The exact interpretation of an auxiliary thread is
 * memory model specific.

   * making any changes to the program state, and without considering
   * the event to have been executed. During dry run, the TraceBuilder
   * will collect information about the event through calls to the
